# Rust-stack regression runner

`rust_regression_run.sh` is a lightweight regression gate for the **Rust
control plane** (`noetl/server` + `noetl/worker`). It registers + executes a
curated set of fixture playbooks against a running server's HTTP API and prints
a pass/fail matrix; the exit code is the count of non-`COMPLETED` fixtures
(`0` = all green).

It exists alongside the Python-era `fixtures/REGRESSION_TESTING.md` framework
(`master_regression_test.yaml` + pytest), which assumes Python-engine semantics.
This runner drives `/api/execute` directly, so it works against the Rust stack
and points easily at kind or prod.

## Prod-scoped validator (`prod_regression_validate.py`)

`prod_regression_validate.py` is the hardened variant for running against a
**live production** server under the CQRS gate-ON cutover (`PUBLISH_ONLY=true`
+ `STATE_BUILDER=offserver`), where test data is NOT cleanable (no DELETE API,
long retention, shared DB). Differences from the bash runner:

- **Tenant isolation** — registers each fixture under a `prod-e2e-<ts>/`
  catalog-path prefix (rewrites `metadata.path` + any sub-playbook step
  `path`) so every row a run creates is identifiable for operator cleanup.
- **Gate-ON proof per execution** — verifies, directly from the DB via
  `noetl query`, the sole-writer (event rows == distinct ids, 0 `catalog_id=0`,
  0 `__orchestrate__` event rows, ≥1 `__orchestrate__` command) + clean-chain
  (roots=1 / terminals=1 / dangling=0 / head-walk == rows) invariants, plus
  the never-scan invariant (worker
  `noetl_worker_state_builder_event_scans_total` delta 0) and materializer lag
  from `/metrics`.
- **Materialization-aware** — waits for the system-pool materializer to project
  the terminal event before asserting (status flips from in-memory drive state
  a moment before the rows land under PUBLISH_ONLY).

```bash
# port-forward the prod server + system-pool /metrics first, then:
scripts/prod_regression_validate.py --base http://localhost:18082 \
    --prefix prod-e2e-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M) --set smoke
scripts/prod_regression_validate.py --base http://localhost:18082 \
    --prefix prod-e2e-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M) --set core
```

The `smoke`/`core` sets are credential-free / in-cluster-only fixtures. Fixtures
needing external creds/services (pagination test-server, external HTTP egress,
`pg_local`/`pg_noetl_k8s` unreachable from prod, auth0/amadeus/openai/IB/
snowflake) and the heavy/OOM/burst fixtures are deliberately excluded — see the
script's `SKIP_NOTES`. First validated against live prod 2026-06-20 (server
v3.39.1 / worker v5.40.2): 28/30 executions PASS, the 2 non-PASS being
pg-credential-unreachable env differences (clean `playbook.failed` terminal +
single-root chain — the failure path is gate-ON-correct), not cutover bugs.

## Usage

```bash
# port-forward the Rust server first, e.g. kind:
kubectl --context kind-noetl -n noetl port-forward svc/noetl-server-rust 18082:8082 &

# run the curated green 'core' set (exit 0 when all pass)
scripts/rust_regression_run.sh http://localhost:18082 core

# run an arbitrary newline list of fixture yaml paths
scripts/rust_regression_run.sh http://localhost:18082 my-list.txt
```

## Batched runner

`rust_regression_batched.sh <list> [context] [chunk]` wraps the runner and
**restarts the port-forward per chunk**, so long full-suite sweeps don't fail
when a single `kubectl port-forward` drops (the cause of mass `REG_FAIL` on
150-fixture runs). Aggregates a final tally to `/tmp/batched_results.txt`.

```bash
scripts/rust_regression_batched.sh /tmp/mylist.txt kind-noetl 12
```

## The `core` set

**64 Rust-convention fixtures** — no external cloud APIs/creds, no Python-era
`libs:`/`context.get()`/`data:`-body. All verified green against the Rust
control plane on kind (2026-06-14). Coverage: basic python + args + large
results, loops + iteration isolation, control-flow routing,
vars/templating/transient, retry (python/http/duckdb), fanout/parallelism,
sub-playbook composition, output selection, pagination (8 patterns), duckdb,
http, storage tiers, **and the full postgres-backed batch** (batch execution,
save-storage, psycopg, auth schema, etc.).

### The kind credential-store fix that unlocked the postgres batch

Postgres fixtures were originally flaky — intermittent `Decryption failed`.
Root cause: the kind `noetl-secret` never defined `NOETL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, so the
server fell back to a **random default key regenerated on every restart**
(`NOETL_ALLOW_INSECURE_DEFAULT_KEY=true`); credentials encrypted before a
restart couldn't decrypt after. Fixed in `noetl/ops`
`ci/manifests/noetl/secret.yaml` (stable dev key) + re-registering credentials
— a postgres fixture went from flaky to consistent green and the suite green
count jumped 40 → 65.

This is the **regression baseline**: grow it by migrating more fixtures to Rust
conventions (tracked in noetl/ai-meta#98).

### Migration patterns (Rust engine vs the Python era)

The same class of fixes done for `auth0_login` (noetl/e2e#51) applies across the
suite:

- **Entry step must be named `start`** — the Rust engine requires it
  (`Workflow must have a step named 'start'`). Rename the entry step and any
  `{{ <old_name> }}` result references. (Migrated `widget_all_types`,
  `pft_queue_db_maintenance` this way.)
- **`libs:` → explicit `import`** in python tool code.
- **`context.get()` → `input:` binding + `args.get()`**.
- **http body `data:` → `json:`**.
- **`python` tool `source.type: inline` → `code:`**.

### Not in `core` (need resources or unsupported kinds)

External-resource fixtures (GCS / OpenAI / external HTTP fetch / IB / local
script files) and ones using tool kinds not ported to Rust (e.g. `kind: agent`
in `spike_e2e_test`) are excluded — they need creds/resources or engine work,
not just convention migration. See noetl/ai-meta#98 for the backlog.

## The `integration` set

```bash
scripts/rust_regression_run.sh http://localhost:18082 integration
```

**12 external-service fixtures** that need **real credentials** and have
**side effects / cost** — NOT part of the exit-0 `core` gate; run deliberately.
Verified green on kind 2026-06-14 with real creds registered (local
`/credentials` dir + GCP Secret Manager, project `noetl-demo-19700101`).

| Fixtures | Credential | Side effect on run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `amadeus_ai_*` (×4) | Amadeus test API (Secret Manager) | read-only GET — safe |
| `ops/*_ai_*` (×3) | OpenAI/Anthropic (Secret Manager via google-oauth) | **$ per call** |
| `weather_control_flow`, `tooling_non_blocking` | open-meteo / mixed | external HTTP |
| `ibkr_gateway_{verify,maintain}` | `ib_gateway` | brokerage gateway (no-op without a running gateway) |

Register creds first: external-service cred JSONs from the local `credentials`
dir (NOT the `pg_*` ones — those point at prod) + OpenAI/Amadeus from Secret
Manager.

### Known external failures (not in `integration`)

- **Snowflake** (`snowflake_postgres`, `http_to_databases`) — the Rust worker's
  credential resolver doesn't yet handle the `snowflake` credential type
  (`unsupported type 'snowflake'`); tracked + fixed separately.
- **IB trading endpoints** (`gateway_test`, `ibkr/api`, `ibkr/history`) — need a
  live IB gateway; fail on connection in kind.
- `cache_simple` — `malformed tool config` (convention); `spike_e2e_test` —
  `kind: agent` unsupported in the Rust engine.
- `matrixcare_snowflake_prod` fixtures are **deliberately excluded** (prod
  Snowflake).
